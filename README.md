# remote-linux-monitor
The Remote Linux Monitor's graphical user interface is similar to and inspired by Gnome's System Monitor. All connections are made using a secure shell and there is no agent software to install on the remote server. You can monitor Linux servers from Windows, Mac or Linux clients. The system is ideal for monitoring headless servers.

I compiled and packaged as a mac app. Find the DMG file in the repository.
Compiled with java 1.8. Tested on MacOSX Catalina.
Best of luck!
